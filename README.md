# TravelApp

This app is project five in Udacity's front end developer nanodegree 
I used three APIs, the geonames API to get the longitude and latitude coordinates from the users input
Then I used the weatherbit API along with the longitude and latitude from geonames to get the weather data for the location entered
Finally I used the pixabay API to display an image of the location.
The API keys are hidden in the .env file and then stored as a variable in src/server/server.js

To run this project use:
npm run build then
npm start
